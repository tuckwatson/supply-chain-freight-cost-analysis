**Supply Chain Freight Cost Analysis**

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes freight costs within a global supply chain management system, specifically focusing on data provided by the Supply Chain Management System (SCMS). The goal is to uncover key factors that impact freight costs and build predictive models to estimate freight costs based on various input features. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and a simple Flask web application for real-time cost prediction.

**Key Features**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigate the dataset to uncover trends, anomalies, patterns, and relationships between variables.
Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning techniques to predict freight costs, starting with a Random Forest Regressor.

Interactive Visualizations: Generate insightful visualizations to present findings and model outcomes using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Web Application: Deploy a Flask web application that users can interact with to predict freight costs using the trained model.
Technologies Used

Python: For data processing and machine learning.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation.

Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.

Flask: For deploying the model as a web application.
