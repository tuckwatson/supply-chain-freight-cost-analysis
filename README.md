# Supply Chain Freight Cost Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the freight costs within a global supply chain management system, focusing on data provided by the Supply Chain Management System (SCMS). The goal is to uncover key factors that impact freight costs and build predictive models to estimate these costs based on various input features.

## Repository Structure
- `SCMS_Delivery_History_Dataset_20150929.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.
- `supply_chain_analysis.py`: Python script for automated data cleaning, processing, and model training.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigates the dataset to uncover trends, anomalies, patterns, and relationships between variables.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning techniques to predict freight costs.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates insightful visualizations to present findings and model outcomes using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.8+). You also need to install the following packages:
```
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter

Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-freight-cost-analysis.git

Running the Python Script:
To run the automated script for data cleaning and modeling:
        python supply_chain_analysis.py


Running the Notebook:
Navigate to the cloned directory and start the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset:

        cd supply-chain-freight-cost-analysis
        jupyter notebook

Open modeling.ipynb and run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.
